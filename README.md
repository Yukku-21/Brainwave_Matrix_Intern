Welcome to the **Brainwave Matrix Internship Project** repository! This project is a culmination of my internship experience at **Brainwave Matrix**, where I had the opportunity to dive into the world of software development with a focus on **Java**, **Collection Framework**, **OOPs Concepts**, and more.

Throughout the internship, I developed skills in various programming methodologies, improved my problem-solving abilities, and contributed to a real-world application. This repository contains the codebase for all the work I completed, which demonstrates my learning and hands-on experience in software development.
